## What is Azure Data Box?
Azure Data Box is a physical data transfer solution that allows you to securely move large amounts of data to Azure when network bandwidth is limited or unavailable. Microsoft ships a physical device to your location, you copy data onto it, and send it back for upload into Azure.

Think of it as:
> A “cloud hard drive” shipped to your data center to move massive data quickly and securely.
