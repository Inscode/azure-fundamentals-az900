# Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud deployment models define **where cloud resources are located** and **who manages them**.

There are three main types:
- Public Cloud
- Private Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud

## 1️⃣ Public Cloud

### Definition
Public cloud is a cloud environment owned and operated by a third-party cloud provider and delivered over the internet.

Example providers:
- Microsoft Azure
- AWS
- Google Cloud

### Key Characteristics
- Shared infrastructure (multi-tenant)
- Accessible over the internet
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- No hardware management required

### Advantages
- No upfront cost
- Highly scalable
- Global availability
- Fast deployment

### Disadvantages
- Less control over infrastructure
- Shared environment

### Example
Hosting a website on Microsoft Azure without owning any servers.

## 2️⃣ Private Cloud

### Definition
Private cloud is a cloud environment used exclusively by a single organization.

It can be:
- Hosted on-premises (company data center)
- Hosted by a third-party provider

- Greater control
- Higher security customization

### Advantages

- Custom configurations

### Disadvantages

## 3️⃣ Hybrid Cloud

### Definition
Hybrid cloud combines public cloud and private cloud, allowing data and applications to move between them.

### Key Characteristics
- Mix of public and private environments
- Flexible workload distribution
- Improved disaster recovery options
