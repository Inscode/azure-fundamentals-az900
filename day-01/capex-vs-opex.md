# Capital Expenditure (CapEx) vs Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

CapEx and OpEx describe **how organizations spend money on IT infrastructure**.

Understanding this difference is important for cloud computing and AZ-900.

---

## 1️⃣ Capital Expenditure (CapEx)

### Definition
Capital Expenditure (CapEx) refers to **upfront investment** in physical assets such as servers, data centers, and networking equipment.

### Characteristics
- Large upfront cost
- Assets are owned by the organization
- Long-term investment
- Hardware depreciation over time
- Requires capacity planning

### Examples
- Buying physical servers
- Building a data center
- Purchasing networking equipment

### In Traditional IT
- Organizations buy hardware in advance
- Pay for maximum capacity even if unused

## 2️⃣ Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

### Definition
Operational Expenditure (OpEx) refers to **ongoing, pay-as-you-go expenses** for services used over time.

### Characteristics
- No upfront cost
- Pay only for what you use
- Flexible and scalable
- Monthly or usage-based billing

### Examples
- Paying monthly for Azure virtual machines
- Cloud storage usage charges
- Subscription-based software

### In Cloud Computing
- Resources can be scaled up or down
- Costs align with actual usage

## CapEx vs OpEx Comparison

| Feature | CapEx | OpEx |
|------|------|------|
| Upfront cost | High | Low / None |
| Payment model | One-time purchase | Pay-as-you-go |
| Ownership | Organization owns assets | Cloud provider owns assets |
| Scalability | Limited | Highly scalable |
| Maintenance | Organization responsible | Provider responsible |

## Why Cloud Uses OpEx Model
- No need to buy hardware
- Faster deployment
- Better cost control
- Ideal for changing workloads

---

## Real-World Example
- **CapEx:** Buying servers to host an application
- **OpEx:** Hosting the same application on Azure and paying monthly

---

## Tips
📌 Cloud computing mainly follows the **OpEx model**, not CapEx.
