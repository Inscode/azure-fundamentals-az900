# Consumption-Based Model 

## Definition
The consumption-based model is a pricing model used in cloud computing where you **pay only for the resources you use**, similar to utilities like electricity or water.

There is **no upfront cost**, and billing is based on actual usage.

---

## Key Characteristics
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- No upfront investment
- Costs depend on usage
- Scale resources up or down at any time
- Stop paying when resources are stopped or deleted

---

## How It Works in Cloud Computing
- You create cloud resources (VMs, storage, databases)
- You are billed based on:
  - Time used (hours/minutes)
  - Amount of storage used
  - Data transferred
- When usage stops, billing stops (for most services)

---

## Benefits of the Consumption-Based Model
- **Cost-efficient** – no payment for unused resources
- **Flexible** – scale based on demand
- **Predictable spending** – monitor and control costs
- **Fast innovation** – try services without long-term commitment

## Consumption Model vs Traditional Model

| Feature | Traditional IT | Consumption-Based Model |
|------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Upfront cost | High | None |
| Payment | Fixed | Based on usage |
| Scalability | Limited | High |
| Risk | High (over-provisioning) | Low |

---

## Real-World Example
- Running a virtual machine for 5 hours → pay for 5 hours
- Stopping the VM → compute charges stop
- Storing 10 GB of data → pay only for 10 GB

---

## Relation to OpEx
- Consumption-based model follows **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**
- No capital investment is required

---

## Tips
📌 Keywords to remember:
- Pay-as-you-go  
- Pay only for what you use  
- No upfront cost  
- Stop using = stop paying (for most services)

📌 If the exam mentions **utility-style billing**, it refers to the **consumption-based model**.
