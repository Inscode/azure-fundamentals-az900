# What is Cloud Computing?

## Definition
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as **servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics** over the internet (the *cloud*) instead of using local physical hardware.

These services are provided on a **pay-as-you-go** basis, meaning you pay only for what you use.
