# AZ-900 — Azure Container Services 

## Overview
Azure provides several services to run and manage containers depending on your needs. These services allow you to deploy applications quickly, scale easily, and avoid managing underlying infrastructure.

Main Azure container services:
- Azure Container Instances (ACI)
- Azure Container Apps
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

---

## Azure Container Instances (ACI)

### What is ACI?
Azure Container Instances lets you run containers without managing servers or clusters. It is the fastest way to run a container in Azure.

### Key Features
- No infrastructure management
- Fast startup
- Pay only for what you use
- Simple deployment

### Use Cases
- Short-lived workloads
- Batch processing
- Development and testing
- Automation tasks

---

## Azure Container Apps

### What is Container Apps?
Azure Container Apps is a serverless platform designed for running containerized applications and microservices with automatic scaling.

### Key Features
- Automatic scaling
- Built-in load balancing
- Supports microservices architecture
- Event-driven workloads
- Simplified management

### Use Cases
- Web APIs
- Background processing
- Event-driven applications
- Modern cloud-native apps

---

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

### What is AKS?
Azure Kubernetes Service is a managed Kubernetes platform used for deploying and managing complex containerized applications at scale.

### Key Features
- Container orchestration
- Auto scaling
- Self-healing workloads
- Rolling updates
- Advanced networking and security

### Use Cases
- Large-scale applications
- Enterprise workloads
- Complex microservices systems
- Production environments

## Complexity Levels

| Level | Service |
|------|--------|
| Simple | Container Instances |
| Moderate | Container Apps |
| Advanced | AKS |

---

## When to Use Each Service
- Use Container Instances for quick and simple container execution.
- Use Container Apps for scalable applications without managing clusters.
- Use AKS when you need full orchestration and control.

---

## AZ-900 Exam Tips
- ACI is the simplest container service.
- Container Apps provides serverless scaling.
- AKS is used for orchestration.
- Understand the purpose of each service.

---

## Quick Summary
- Azure supports multiple container services.
- Choose based on complexity and control needs.
- Containers help run applications consistently across environments.
