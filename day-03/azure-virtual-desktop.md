## What is Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)?
Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) is a cloud service that allows users to access a full Windows desktop or individual applications remotely from anywhere using the internet.

Think of it as:
> Your work computer running in Azure that you connect to remotely.

## Simple Explanation
Instead of installing apps and storing data on your local laptop, everything runs in Azure. You log in and use your desktop as if you were sitting in the office.

---

## Key Features
- Access Windows desktop remotely
- Run apps securely in the cloud
- Multi-user support (many users share resources)
- Centralized management
- Secure remote access
- Accessible from browser, laptop, or mobile

## Why Organizations Use AVD
- Remote work and hybrid work
- Secure access for contractors
- Call centers and support teams

## How AVD Works (Basic Flow)
1. User signs in with credentials
2. Azure authenticates the user
3. User connects to virtual desktop or apps
4. Workloads run on Azure virtual machines
